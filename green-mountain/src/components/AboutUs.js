						Co-founder Joseph S. Dicton, Jr. is the only child of Joseph Sr. and
						Marian Dicton. The Dicton 22-acre homestead was purchased in 1978
						and the three worked to clear the land and establish Joe’s Nursery
						and Landscaping, a going concern until Joe Sr. passed in 2003. Long
						roots in the nursery business from cultivation through retail sales
						and installation of same, Joseph Jr. earned his green thumb. Joe is
						deeply rooted and very connected to his community, serving on the
						Rutland Town Fire Department and Rutland Town Select Board, also as
						its chairman. Always loving the horticultural business, he continues
						to get his hands dirty and garden while working full time with Green
						Mountain Power. Stephanie Brush, co-founder, spent a business career
						growing clients. Two decades of working for multi-national companies
						in the technology sector focused on Business Development brings a
						unique skill set for nurturing relationships, collaboration, and
						problem solving. Growing up in Middletown, PA her Family planted a
						vegetable garden every Summer – tomatoes, lettuce, beets, cucumbers,
						and anything else that fills a salad bowl. All that was to a lesser
						degree than her father, Ted, grew up tending with his 12 siblings.
						Always people around to share a laugh and a meal. Stephanie’s love
						of cooking with fresh ingredients and entertaining began early.
						Nurturing loved ones is at the core of who she is as a person. Our
						cannabis journey began in that nurturing way during Summer 2018 with
						the advent of legal recreational cannabis use in Vermont. After a
						lifetime of suffering intense migraine headaches, Joe was curious
						about the many purported healing properties and so we grew 2 weed
						plants fondly nicknamed Chip & Dip. Joe is migraine free today and
						his great outcome is attributed to healing cannabis. We have a joint
						passion and talents to grow natural, handcrafted, healing cannabis
						for its many benefits and the enjoyment of Vermonters. Experiencing
						the healthful properties of cannabis and envisioning opportunity to
						reclaim those roots and branch into cannabis cultivation is a
						natural melding of both Joe’s and Stephanie’s talents and a welcomed
						business proposition. Green Mountain Ganja Guys was established to
						fulfill that vision. We are uniquely positioned to that end as
						landowners with cultivation experience in the heart of our Green
						Mountain state for decades.
