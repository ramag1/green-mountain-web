				Green Mountain Ganja Guys was born out of a lifelong love of
				gardening, local Vermont culture and the search for a cure for
				migraines. Co-founders Joe Dicton and Stephanie Brush began their
				cannabis journey in that nurturing way during Summer 2018 with the
				advent of legal recreational cannabis use in Vermont. Suffering from
				frequent migraines, Joe was curious about the many purported healing
				properties and so, with help from his savvy green-thumb, they grew 2
				weed plants fondly nicknamed Chip & Dip. Joe is migraine free today
				and his great outcome is attributed to healing cannabis. Joe and
				Stephanieâ€™s goal is to share their passion and talents for growing
				natural, handcrafted, healing cannabis for its many benefits and the
				enjoyment of Vermonters.
